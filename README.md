### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
<p>
  Welcome! I'm Renard â€” a Front-End developer currently studying Systems Analysis. I've worked with several tools used to build modern web apps, like <strong>Angular</strong>, <strong>ReactJS</strong>, <strong>Next.js</strong>, <strong>MongoDB</strong>, <strong>SASS</strong>, and <strong>Git</strong>. I also have some Back-End experience with <strong>Express.js</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>, which helps me understand how things work from start to finish.
</p>

<p>
  Right now, I'm focusing on learning more about <strong>Angular</strong> to grow my Front-End skills. I'm always up for learning new things and love building digital solutions that are easy to use and bring something new to the table. My projects show how I like to mix good planning, clean design, and solid functionality.
</p>

<p>
  I'm currently looking for my first job as a developer, where I can work with others and take on real-world challenges. Feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/renardbergson?tab=repositories">repositories</a> to see how I tackled different problems.
